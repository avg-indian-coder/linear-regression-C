# linear-regression-C
Simple linear regression in C (incomplete, more additions on the way)

Takes a table of values as input, read from a file name 'input.txt' in the same directory. There is a sample input file in the repo, with first column being the independant variable, and the second column being the dependant variable.

The program outputs the estimated values of y-intercept and slope, along with the coefficient of determination.
